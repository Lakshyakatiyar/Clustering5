    "1. A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It presents a summary of the predictions made by a model against the actual ground truth across different classes. The matrix is typically organized into rows and columns, with rows representing the actual classes and columns representing the predicted classes. Each cell in the matrix represents the count of instances where the actual class (row) corresponds to the predicted class (column). It allows for a quick visualization of the model's performance, highlighting where it is making correct predictions and where it is making errors."

    "2.A pair confusion matrix is used in situations where there are pairs of classes of particular interest, rather than all possible classes. Unlike a regular confusion matrix, which considers all classes, a pair confusion matrix focuses only on the specified pairs of classes. This can be useful in scenarios where certain classes are of higher importance or where the performance between specific pairs of classes is critical to assess. By narrowing the focus to specific pairs, it provides a more targeted evaluation of the model's performance for those particular classes."

    "3. In natural language processing (NLP), an extrinsic measure is a performance evaluation metric that assesses the effectiveness of a language model within the context of a specific downstream task. These tasks could include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, etc. Extrinsic measures involve evaluating the model's performance based on its actual utility and effectiveness in completing these tasks, rather than just its performance on isolated benchmarks or metrics."

    "4. An intrinsic measure in the context of machine learning refers to performance evaluation metrics that assess the quality of a model based solely on its internal characteristics or behavior, without considering its performance on any specific external tasks. These metrics are typically calculated using aspects such as model complexity, convergence, generalization ability, and other internal properties. Intrinsic measures are useful for understanding the behavior of models in isolation, but they may not directly correlate with real-world performance"

    "5.The purpose of a confusion matrix in machine learning is to provide a detailed breakdown of the performance of a classification model. It allows for the identification of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives across different classes. By analyzing the entries of the confusion matrix, one can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the model. For instance, a high number of false positives in a particular class may indicate a problem with misclassification for that class, while a high number of true positives indicates the model's ability to correctly identify instances of that class."

    "6.Common intrinsic measures used to evaluate the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms include measures of cluster quality such as silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, and within-cluster sum of squares. These measures assess the compactness and separation of clusters in the data. A silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, while the Davies–Bouldin index evaluates the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster. The within-cluster sum of squares measures the dispersion of points within each cluster. These measures provide insights into the structure and quality of the clusters formed by the algorithm."

    "7. Limitations of using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks include its inability to account for class imbalances, differing misclassification costs, and the inability to distinguish between types of errors (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives). These limitations can be addressed by using alternative evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR). These metrics provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's performance, especially in scenarios where class distributions are uneven or misclassification costs vary between classes. Additionally, using techniques like stratified sampling, resampling methods, or cost-sensitive learning can help mitigate the impact of class imbalances on model evaluation.\n",
